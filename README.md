# Item NPC
 Customizable NPC for Garry's Mod that players can purchase items from. This addon is made for server developers and cannot be used as-is. It was designed for DarkRP and my Half-Life Universe RP server, but it can be made to work with other gamemodes with minor tweaks. See the shared.lua file for more info.
